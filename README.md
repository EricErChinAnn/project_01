As Singaporean become more and more health-conscious. The number of people wanting to be more active have been increasing over the years, especially after the COVID-19 pandamic (2020).

This application will benefit new gym-goers by showing them the near-by Gym & Studio with the reviews by actual public. On top of that it shows the food center near the selected gym and the weather. For the vetarans it also provide them with a health tracker system for better self-accessment.
